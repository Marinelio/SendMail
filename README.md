# ðŸ“§ SendMail â€“ Simple Python Email Sender

**SendMail** is a Python script that allows you to send custom messages via email using Gmail's SMTP server. It is designed to be simple, lightweight, and easily embeddable in terminal-based or command-line applications.

## ðŸ“‹ Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get the SendMail script running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marinelio/SendMail.git
cd SendMail

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

This script doesn't have any external dependencies, as it only uses Python's built-in libraries for email sending and socket communication. However, itâ€™s a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage your Python environment.

#### Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)

- On **Windows**:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
